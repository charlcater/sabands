# sabands

Run the Jupyter notebook for the latest version

~Usage: `$python3 sabands.py <input_list.csv>` 
 eg: $_python3 sabands.py sabands.csv_~

Outputs 'out.txt' with two albums, and cover art (if available) in the folder _'out'_. Newest selection is written to the end of the file each time.

An updated .csv list with the same name as the input file is generated, but with the albums selected in in the previous round deleted. This can be used in a following round.
